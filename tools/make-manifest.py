"""Write MANIFEST.txt: the sha256 of every committed file.

    python tools/make-manifest.py

Run it after any change to the tree, and before committing.  `tests/test_repo.py`
fails when the manifest disagrees with the working tree, which is what keeps a
hand-edited file from being shipped under a stale hash.

The skip list mirrors .gitignore: build output, bytecode, and the files a run
writes beside the bridge (boot logs, the status snapshot, the loader's target
hint) are not part of the repository and are not listed.
