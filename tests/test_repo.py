"""This repository must be self-describing and internally consistent.

Three kinds of failure this file exists to catch, all of which have happened in
the project these repositories came from:

* a shipped binary that does not match the build record beside it, so a user
  installs something nobody built - the manifest and the build record are the
  two statements of provenance, and they must agree;
* a manifest that has drifted from the working tree, so a hand-edited file ships
  under a stale hash;
* a test run that exercises a copy of the code living somewhere else, which
  reports green for a tree this repository does not contain.

It also asserts that the paths `prompt.md` tells an agent to run are present, and
that the ones its own steps build were not committed as if they were source: a
prompt that names a file which is not here is worse than no prompt.
